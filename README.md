# ‚Ä¢ What is SHOUP ‚ùì

SHOUP (Script Hook Online Universal Patcher) is a tool created to bypass online access restriction from **Script Hook V** &amp; **Script Hook RDR2** made by <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/">Alexander Blade</a>.

# ‚Ä¢ How it works üõ†

Place <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/">ScriptHookV.dll</a> and/or <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/">ScriptHookRDR2.dll</a> in the same folder as "SHOUP.exe", execute "SHOUP.exe" and then patch the desired Dll(s).

After patching it, Drag and drop the patched Dll to your GTAV / RDR2 game folder.

Use Any Internal Injector : dinput8.dll - dsound.dll - xinput1_3.dll. (Know that dinput8.dll is blacklisted in GTAV !)

Finally drag and drop the desired <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/most-downloaded">Script Hook V ASI Scripts</a> and/or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/categories/16/">Script Hook RDR2 .ASI Scripts</a> in your game folder.

Very few .ASI Scripts might not work as they are blocking you from joining Online.

Anyway, Enjoy ;)
