# • What is SHOUP ❓

SHOUP (Script Hook Online Universal Patcher) is a tool created to bypass online access restriction from **Script Hook V** &amp; **Script Hook RDR2** made by <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/">Alexander Blade</a>.

# • How it works 🛠

Place <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/">ScriptHookV.dll</a> and/or <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/">ScriptHookRDR2.dll</a> in the same folder as "SHOUP.exe", execute "SHOUP.exe" and then patch the desired Dll(s).

After patching it, Drag and drop the patched Dll to your GTAV / RDR2 game folder.

Use Any Internal Injector : dinput8.dll - dsound.dll - xinput1_3.dll. (Know that dinput8.dll is blacklisted in GTA V)

Finally drag and drop the desired .ASI mods in your game folder. 

You can found some GTAV ASI Script here : https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/categories/16/

Very Few ASI Scripts might not work as they are blocking you from joining Online.

Anyway, Enjoy ;)
